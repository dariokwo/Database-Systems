Persisted: Ensured persistent by storing data in a JSON file 

When initializing a new Database, a New JSON file is created with the name of the database <br>
All Collections for one database will be stored in one JSON file 

When opening and Existing Database, the corresponding JSON file is is open and the data will be loaded <br>

Works like MangoDB, Firestore, or Atlass, but it's lightweight <br>
Convenient for small projects
