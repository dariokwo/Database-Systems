# Database-Systems

Created a lightweight Pyhton NoSQL database using Object Oriented Principles
Persisted: Ensured persistent of data by storing data in a JSON file 

When initializing a new Database, a New JSON file is created with the name of the database
All Collections for one database will be stored in one JSON file 

When opening and Existing Database, the corresponding JSON file is is open and the data will be loaded 
to the running program

Works like MangoDB, Firestore, or Atlass, but it lightweight 
Convenient for small projects
